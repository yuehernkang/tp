##Overview:
Condonery is a desktop app made for property agents primarily used for managing client contacts and property listings. 
It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Enhancements implemented: 

- New Feature: Added the ability to filter by PropertyStatusEnum (Pull Request [#115](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/pull/115))
  - What it does: allows the user to filter properties by their respective status (`AVAILABLE`, `PENDING`, `SOLD`). 
  - Justification: This feature improves the user experience of Condonery because it allows the user to 
  know which properties are `AVAILABLE`, `PENDING` or `SOLD` without scrolling through all the properties listed
  - Highlights: This enhancement affects the existing UI and required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. 
  This implementation was challenging as it
